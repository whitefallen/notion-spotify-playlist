## Current Focus: Rate Limiting Issue - RESOLVED ✅

### Problem Description (RESOLVED)

The script was stopping processing after encountering the second API rate limit error from Spotify. The error message showed:

```
Processing album: BEST OF (Volume 1)...
Error: API rate limit exceeded
```

### Root Cause Analysis (RESOLVED)

The issue was in the `getRecentArtistItems` method in `UpdatePlaylistCommand.php`. The rate limiting handling had critical flaws:

1. **Infinite Loop Risk**: The `continue` statement in the rate limit catch block created infinite loops
2. **Missing Break Condition**: The `do-while` loop continued indefinitely when rate limits were hit repeatedly
3. **Inadequate Error Handling**: The outer try-catch didn't properly handle rate limit exceptions

### Solution Implemented ✅

1. **Added Retry Limits**: Maximum 3 retries per API call
2. **Implemented Exponential Backoff**: `retry_after * attempt_number` delay strategy
3. **Added Graceful Degradation**: Script continues processing even when some requests fail
4. **Comprehensive Protection**: Applied rate limiting protection to all API calls

### Files Modified ✅

- `src/Command/UpdatePlaylistCommand.php` - Fixed rate limiting logic in all methods
- Added retry mechanisms to:
  - Artist album fetching
  - Album tracks fetching
  - Track details fetching
  - Duplicate filtering
  - Unwanted content filtering

### Current Status

**RATE LIMITING ISSUE FIXED** ✅

The script now:

- Handles rate limits gracefully with exponential backoff
- Continues processing other artists/albums when rate limits are hit
- Provides clear logging of retry attempts and failures
- Prevents infinite loops with proper retry limits

## Docker Configuration Issue - FIXED ✅

### Problem Description (RESOLVED)

The Dockerfile was trying to install `php-cli` via apt-get, which was redundant and causing issues because:

- The base image `php:8.1-cli` already includes PHP CLI
- Installing `php-cli` again can cause version conflicts
- The apt package might not have release candidates available

### Solution Implemented ✅

- Removed redundant `php-cli` installation from Dockerfile
- The base image `php:8.1-cli` already provides the necessary PHP CLI functionality
- This eliminates potential dependency conflicts and release candidate issues
