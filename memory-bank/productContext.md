# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement

Music discovery is challenging, especially for users who follow many artists across different genres. Traditional methods like manually checking each artist's new releases are time-consuming and often result in missing new music from favorite artists.

### Solution Overview

This application automates the process of discovering new music by:

1. **Centralizing Artist Management**: Using Notion as a single source of truth for artist lists
2. **Automating Discovery**: Automatically finding recent releases from tracked artists
3. **Curating Content**: Filtering out unwanted content types (instrumentals, live versions, etc.)
4. **Creating Playlists**: Generating monthly Spotify playlists with new releases

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Flow

1. **Setup Phase**: User adds artists to their Notion database
2. **Automation**: System runs monthly to discover new releases
3. **Curation**: System filters and organizes tracks
4. **Delivery**: Monthly playlist appears in user's Spotify account

### Core User Journey

User adds artists to Notion → System discovers new releases →
System filters content → System creates monthly playlist →
User enjoys curated new music
```
