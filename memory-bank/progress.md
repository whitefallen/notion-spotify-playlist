# Progress

## What Works

- âœ… Notion integration for fetching artist list
- âœ… Spotify API authentication and token management
- âœ… Artist album/single discovery from Spotify
- âœ… Track filtering and deduplication
- âœ… Playlist creation and updating
- âœ… Docker containerization and CRON scheduling
- âœ… Basic rate limiting protection (FIXED)

## What's Left to Build

- ðŸ”„ Enhanced error logging and monitoring
- ðŸ”„ Better progress reporting during execution
- ðŸ”„ Configuration for rate limiting parameters
- ðŸ”„ Health checks and monitoring endpoints

## Current Status

**RATE LIMITING ISSUE FIXED** âœ…

### Recent Fixes (Latest Session)

- **Fixed infinite loop in rate limiting**: Added proper retry limits and exponential backoff
- **Added comprehensive rate limiting protection**: All API calls now have retry logic
- **Implemented graceful degradation**: Script continues processing even if some requests fail
- **Added delays between requests**: Prevents hitting rate limits as frequently

### Technical Implementation Details

- **Retry Strategy**: Maximum 3 retries per API call with exponential backoff
- **Rate Limit Detection**: Proper handling of HTTP 429 status codes
- **Graceful Failure**: Script continues processing other artists/albums when rate limits are hit
- **Request Throttling**: Added delays between API calls (100ms-1000ms depending on operation)

## Known Issues

- None currently identified after rate limiting fix

## Evolution of Project Decisions

1. **Initial Approach**: Simple try-catch with basic retry
2. **Problem Identified**: Infinite loops when rate limits were hit repeatedly
3. **Solution Implemented**: Proper retry limits with exponential backoff and graceful degradation
4. **Future Considerations**: May need to add configuration options for retry parameters
